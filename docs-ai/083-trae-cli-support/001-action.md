# 083 — TraeCode CLI (`traecli`) Support: Action Log

## Timeline

| Date | Change | Ref |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-12 | Verified `traecli` 0.201.7 (`--help`, `exec --help`): `-m/--model`, `-c/--config <key=value>`, `--permission-mode <bypass_permissions\|auto\|default>`, `-y/--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`; `exec [PROMPT]`. Confirmed `TRAE_HOME` relocates the whole `~/.trae` tree (config and `cli/sessions`) | branch `feature/traecli-support` |
| 2026-10-12 | Added `DetectedAgent.trae`, `AgentProfileRuntime.trae`, `TraeRuntimeAdapter`, session profile, legacy screen detector, classifier entries, tab icon, skill target, CLI schema enums, docs, and tests | branch `feature/traecli-support` |
| 2026-10-12 | Green: `make build-app`, `make check`, CLI build/unit/smoke/integration, focused app suites (`TraeSupportTests`, `AgentClassifierTests`, `AgentRuntimeAdapterTests`, `AgentSessionResolverTests`, `ScreenHeuristicsTests`) | branch `feature/traecli-support` |
| 2026-10-14 | Live on-prem 0.201.7 TUI showed the detector missed the two-space-indented status row and the `◆ Working…` line above the composer; rewrote `detectTrae` to match the status row by signature and read the working indicator first | branch `fork/trae-cli` |
| 2026-10-14 | A finished traecli turn never reached Prowl's inbox because the CLI's `tui.notifications` defaults off; `TraeRuntimeAdapter.makeStartInvocation` now injects `-c tui.notifications=true -c tui.notification_method=osc9 -c tui.notification_condition=always` (values verified accepted by the on-prem binary) | branch `fork/trae-cli` |
| 2026-10-15 | Active Agents showed a running traecli turn as Idle/Done: the detector searched for the `esc to interrupt` hint in a fixed four rows above the prompt, but traecli heads the live block with a multi-row todo checklist (or a wrapped indicator/tip) that pushes the hint five or more rows up, so the idle status row decided. `traeComposer` now reads the hint from the blank-bounded non-blank run directly above the prompt instead | branch `fork/trae-cli` |
| 2026-10-15 | Live capture: an MCP tool approval (and an elicitation form) read as Working instead of Blocked. The dialog replaces the composer and is rendered inside the live block's two-space gutter, so the `❯` selection mark is indented, not column-0; `hasTraeChoiceDialog` required column 0, returned false, and the state machine kept the stale Working. `hasTraeLiveDialog` now matches the mark by shape (indent-agnostic) and also accepts a form footer (` to submit`, `to navigate fields/questions`) for option-less input forms | branch `fork/trae-cli` |
| 2026-10-15 | Closed the three residual gaps from the traecli detection audit. (1) `detectionScreenText` now reads the whole active screen for `.trae` (not the 24-line tail) and `traeComposer` treats only the bottom-most composer box as live, so a tall todo checklist can no longer push the running hint out of the slice and read a running turn as idle. (2) A composer with no running hint and no recognized status row now reads Idle instead of unknown, so the state machine cannot retain a stale Working. (3) `hasTraeLiveDialog` also recognizes bracketed y/n confirmations and the interactive login/auth screens (verified header phrase plus Enter/Esc chrome) as Blocked. Added `traeBlockerText` and opened `prowl agents read` to `trae` panes (blocker text only; no semantic result reader) | branch `fork/trae-cli` |
| 2026-10-16 | A cold start showed a spurious Done badge after traecli finished booting. traecli heads the live block with an MCP boot progress line (`✧ Starting MCP servers (1/3): XcodeBuildMCP, code-review-graph (0s • esc to interrupt)`) above an otherwise idle composer; it reuses the interrupt footer, so `hasTraeInterruptHint` read the boot phase as Working and the settle to the idle composer earned a legacy `working → idle` Done. `hasTraeInterruptHint` now excludes that boot line via `isTraeStartupProgressLine` (scoped to the `starting mcp server` phrase, so a real turn titled `Starting …` still reads Working), so startup settles straight to Idle with no transition to reward | branch `fork/trae-cli` |
| 2026-10-19 | After the 0.209.1 upgrade the Active Agents row flapped Working → Idle → Working during long turns. traecli repaints its live region on the TUI's own clock — its own log records `slow TUI draw interval` at up to ~1 s while a turn streams — and the running footer is the only evidence separating Working from Idle (the composer's status row, `… · Context <n>% left · …`, reads identically in both), so a poll landing on a frame whose footer is not painted back read Idle and was published on its own. A lone Idle verdict over a Working pane is now held for one poll: `DetectedAgent.requiresConfirmedIdleScreen` marks the agents whose Working evidence is screen-only (`trae`), `AgentStateMachine` applies the hold on the screen fallback, and `AgentDetectionCoordinator` sets it when it binds the agent. Idle → Working, Working → Blocked, and settling from unknown stay immediate, so a starting turn and a dialog are never delayed. Kept separate: a settled turn that is holding background shells (`◇ <n> background shell running… you can still chat · /ps to manage`) stays Idle by decision — the agent handed control back, only the shell runs, and a running background shell is not Working evidence (the hysteresis does not mask it, because a real settle publishes on the second poll) | branch `fork/trae-cli` |
| 2026-10-20 | A running turn still flipped to Idle during long turns, from a cause unrelated to repaint gaps: traecli **clips live chrome to the pane width**, so a wide live-block header (the streaming snippet) pushed the footer's own tail off the line and the running mark never reached the terminal. Captured live on 0.209.1 in the frame where the badge flipped: `❖ The live block header … (42m 53s • ↑ 183K tokens …` — no `esc to interrupt`, no `/ps` chrome. Two guards. (1) `hasTraeInterruptHint` also accepts a clipped header — a column-0 live glyph (`✦ ✧ ❖ ◆ ◈ ⋄`, matched by symbol range rather than an enumerated set) followed by the elapsed-time chrome `(<elapsed> •` — and now takes the *raw* row, so the column-0 test survives the screen parser's trimming; prose, tool output (`└ Run finished (2s · timeout 2m)`, indented and `·`-separated), and quoted chrome cannot forge it. (2) An Idle screen verdict is corroborated against the pane's terminal title: the TUI animates a braille spinner ahead of the thread title while a turn runs and drops it when the turn settles (verified live that a background shell left behind does not keep it up, so the deliberate background-shell Idle is preserved), so a spinning title turns the verdict into Working (`screen.titleSpinner`), applied in `WorktreeTerminalState.corroboratedScreenDetection` on the screen path and scoped to `.trae` Idle verdicts — Working, Blocked, and unknown pass through untouched. The title mark is the one running signal the screen cannot lose to clipping, scrolling, or a slow repaint. Added `clippedLiveHeaderKeepingOnlyElapsedChromeReadsAsWorking`, `proseMentioningElapsedChromeWithoutALiveGlyphStaysIdle`, `titleSpinnerMarksARunningTurn`, and `titleSpinnerCorroboratesAnIdleScreenVerdict` to `TraeSupportTests`, and documented both guards in `docs/components/agent-detection.md` | branch `feature/traecli-support` |
| 2026-10-20 | Review follow-ups on the same day's fixes. (1) **A historical composer hid a newer dialog.** `detectTrae` searched for a composer anywhere on the screen and let it decide, so a quoted `❯` box above current approval options read Idle and `traeBlockerText` returned nil. The live region is now resolved by relative position: `traeComposer` reports its closing-border row, `traeLiveDialog` reports its bottom-most chrome row, and the lower of the two decides — preserving both a quoted composer above a live dialog (Blocked) and a quoted dialog above a live composer (Idle, no blocker). (2) **Blocker extraction dropped the question and the arguments.** It walked back only to the first preceding blank line, and a traecli dialog carries one between the question/parameters and the options, so `agents read` returned the options and footer alone. The walk now ends at the first *column-0* row (the dialog renders in the two-space gutter), keeps the whole block, and restores the internal blank lines so the text reads like the pane. (3) **Two Idle observations did not establish that the redraw finished.** The hold confirmed on the next Idle verdict whatever its timing, so two reads of one frame a millisecond apart — `prowl agents read` polls outside the detection cadence — or a burst of Idle frames from a repaint gap settled a running turn. `AgentStateMachine` now requires the Idle verdict to keep arriving for `confirmedIdleWindow` (2 s, above the ~1 s footer gap observed on 0.209.1) and drops the hold on any readable non-Idle frame, so a genuine settle still confirms while Working → Idle → Idle → Working at 300 ms never publishes the intermediate Idle. (4) **The MCP startup exclusion was per row.** A boot line that a terminal wraps puts `esc to interrupt` on a continuation row with none of the `Starting MCP servers` header, so the wrapped form read Working (and earned a spurious Done on the settle). The exclusion now applies to the blank-bounded block; a row that opens the block with a live glyph is always the live region's own footer, so a running turn sharing a block with a boot head is still Working. Validated with a real capture: traecli 0.209.1 in a 40-column PTY **clips** the progress line (`◇ Starting MCP servers (0/3): XcodeBuil…`, chrome and hint cut with `…`) rather than wrapping it, so the real narrow failure mode is "no hint at all" and the wrapped form stays a defensive case. Added `historicalComposerAboveTheApprovalDialogReadsAsBlocked`, `quotedApprovalOptionsAboveTheLiveComposerStayIdle`, `wrappedMcpBootProgressBlockAboveAnIdleComposerReadsAsIdle`, `capturedNarrowTerminalBootScreenReadsAsIdle`, question/parameter assertions on `blockerTextReadsTheLiveDialogAndIsNilOtherwise`, `repeatedIdleReadsInsideTheWindowCannotConfirmATurn`, and an updated `traeIdleFrameIsConfirmedBeforeItEndsTheWorkingTurn` (the replay plus a genuine settle) | branch `feature/traecli-support` |

| 2026-10-20 | Second review round on the same day's fixes, three findings. (1) **Status-bar paths could override the agent state.** Footer matching accepted bare substrings, and the composer's status bar carries the working directory: with the same valid composer, a checkout at `/tmp/how to submit` read as a form footer and turned Idle into Blocked (and overrode a real Working footer), while `/tmp/how to interrupt` turned Idle into Working. The chrome is now matched by its structure — a dialog footer needs its cancel/navigate chrome as well as the submit/navigate phrase, the running interrupt mark has to be parenthesized (`(esc to interrupt)`, `(23s • esc to interrupt)`), the auth chrome has to open with its key chord — and the status bar (model, context, path, permission mode) is excluded from dialog, footer, and running matching by one `isTraeStatusBarRow` predicate. (2) **Blocker extraction dropped unindented dialogs.** The first walk followed indented rows only, so the trust prompt yielded just `2. No, quit` + `Press enter to continue` and the login screen just `Press Esc to cancel`, dropping the question, the selected option, and the choices a caller must read. Detection and extraction now share one `traeDialogRegion`: it walks back from the marker and stops at other chrome (the composer box, its status bar, glyph-headed transcript rows) rather than at indentation, capped at 16 rows, and `traeLiveDialog` returns both the marker and the region so the two cannot disagree. (3) **The fixture capture truncated what runtime detection scans in full.** `scripts/make-detection-fixture.py` accepted `trae` in its vocabulary but not in the full-screen branch, so a 35-line screen with a 30-item checklist was reduced to a 24-line tail and lost the running hint — the generated fixture would classify as Idle where the capture classifies as Working. `trae` joined the full-screen branch, and `test_make_detection_fixture.py` gained the long-checklist case (plus `trae` in the slice-width test). Added `statusBarPathNamingModalChromeStaysIdle`, `transcriptMentioningSubmitWithoutChromeStaysUnknown`, and `blockerTextKeepsUnindentedDialogsWhole` to `TraeSupportTests`, and documented the structural chrome matching and the shared dialog region in `docs/components/agent-detection.md` | branch `feature/traecli-support` |
| 2026-10-20 | Third review round: **the composer's borders were sized by the longest `─` rule on the whole screen.** The pane's text is extracted non-rectangularly and Ghostty joins soft-wrapped lines, so a historical *logical* line can be wider than the pane — the agent's own output leaving a rule behind is enough. A 100-column separator above an otherwise valid composer with 80-column borders made the live border read as "narrower than full width", so `traeComposer` found no box at all: an idle `❯ Draft` read **unknown** (which let the state machine keep the previous turn's Working) and a numbered draft fell through to the dialog shapes — a `❯`-marked option beside an unselected numbered sibling — and read **Blocked**. The closing border now comes from the box's own rows — the column-0 `─` rule the prompt row's draft run ends on — and its width is never measured against the rest of the screen; the live region is still the bottom-most box, so a quoted composer above a live dialog stays Blocked and a quoted dialog above the live composer stays Idle. Added `separatorWiderThanTheComposerAboveItKeepsTheBox` and `numberedDraftUnderAWiderSeparatorStaysIdleInsteadOfBlocked` to `TraeSupportTests` (both reproduced the two failures before the fix) and dropped the now-stale "full-width" wording in `docs/components/agent-detection.md`. Also appended `trae` to the empty-state skills hint in `AgentSkillsSectionView` | branch `feature/traecli-support` |

## Outcome & current state (as of 2026-10-12)

First-class `traecli` support landed at the Antigravity tier (077), with no managed
hook channel. What exists now:

- **Detection** — `DetectedAgent.trae` (rawValue `trae`) in
  `App/Sources/Domain/AgentDetection/DetectedAgent.swift`. `knownAgentBinaries` maps
  `traecli`/`traex`/`trae-cli`/`trae-agent` to it; bare `trae` is deliberately unmapped
  so the IDE launcher is never classified as the CLI. The score-40 native-name guard
  rejects those four names when they appear as prompt/path tokens in a wrapper's argv
  (`App/Sources/Infrastructure/AgentDetection/AgentClassifier.swift`).
- **Profile / runtime** — `AgentProfileRuntime.trae` in
  `App/Sources/Domain/AgentProfile/AgentProfile.swift` (`defaultHomeDirectoryName`
  `.trae`). `TraeRuntimeAdapter` in
  `App/Sources/Domain/AgentRuntime/AgentRuntimeAdapter.swift` reuses Codex's flag
  spellings (`--model`/`-m`; `-c model_reasoning_effort=low|medium|high|xhigh|max`;
  Unrestricted via `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, observed from `-y` or
  `--permission-mode bypass_permissions`), launches `traecli` (prompted seeds a trailing
  positional; headless runs `traecli exec <prompt>`), and declares account isolation
  through `TRAE_HOME` with session root `cli`.
- **Session ownership** — inline `AgentSessionProfile.trae` in
  `App/Sources/Infrastructure/AgentDetection/AgentSessionProfile.swift`: marker
  `/.trae/cli/sessions/`, Codex-shaped day-directory candidate roots under
  `~/.trae/cli/sessions`, full-root fallback, and `TRAE_HOME`-rooted variants.
- **Screen state** — legacy detector in
  `App/Sources/Infrastructure/AgentDetection/ScreenHeuristics.swift` (whole active
  screen, anchored on the bottom-most composer box):
  a live dialog that replaces the composer — a numbered option marked by `❯` beside
  an unselected sibling, a form footer (` to submit`, `to navigate fields`), a
  bracketed y/n prompt, or the login/auth screens — reads Blocked (see the 2026-10-15
  live-capture row: the mark is matched by shape, not column); an
  `esc to interrupt` hint in the blank-bounded block above the box reads Working, except
  the startup MCP boot progress line that reuses the same footer (see the 2026-10-16
  row); the `❯` composer with a `<model> · Context <n>% left · <cwd> ▧ Workspace Edit`
  status
  row reads Idle, and an unrecognized status row under a live composer also reads Idle
  rather than unknown. The `detectLegacyScreen` switch was split into a head/tail pair
  to stay under SwiftLint's cyclomatic-complexity budget.
- **Completion notifications** — traecli's TUI notification is off by default and Prowl's
  inbox is fed only by Ghostty's OSC 9 desktop-notification callback, so `traecli` turns
  were silent. `TraeRuntimeAdapter.makeStartInvocation` injects the three `-c` overrides
  above for every Prowl-launched session; a manually launched `traecli` needs the same
  values under `[tui]` in `~/.trae/traecli.toml`.
- **Icon** — `Trae` asset (`App/Sources/Assets.xcassets/CommandIcons/Trae.imageset/`,
  Simple Icons CC0 mark, template rendering), keyed by `trae`/`trae-cli`/`traecli`/`traex`
  in `App/Sources/Features/Terminal/Models/CommandIconMap.swift`.
- **Skill target** — `SkillInstallTarget(id: "trae", …)` in
  `Shared/Sources/ProwlCLIShared/SkillInstallTarget.swift` (user `~/.trae/skills`, project
  `.agents/skills`), with `trae` added to the four enums in
  `CLI/Sources/ProwlCLIContracts/Resources/cli-output-schema.json` and to the
  `skills`/root help copy in `CLI/Sources/prowl/Commands/`.
- **Tests** — `App/Tests/TraeSupportTests.swift` (detection, adapter launch/observe/isolation,
  session ownership + roots, screen detection) plus `trae` rows in
  `App/Tests/AgentClassifierTests.swift`, `App/Tests/AgentRuntimeAdapterTests.swift`, the
  three `CLI/Tests/ProwlCLITests/*` catalogs, and `scripts/make-detection-fixture.py`.
- **Docs** — `docs/components/{cli,settings,agent-detection,agent-profiles,workflows}.md`
  and `skills/prowl-cli/SKILL.md`, `skills/prowl-workflow/references/authoring.md`.

## Deviations from plan

- **Screen detector ships as legacy, not a typed `TraeScreenProfile`.** As anticipated in
  the plan, the working-footer signature could not be captured against a standalone
  `traecli` TUI (the shared TraeCode app-server was serving this session's own pane), so
  the working rule is the binary-verified `to interrupt` hint and no fixture corpus was
  produced.
- **Managed hook channel remains out of scope** (`hook_trae`), unchanged from the plan.
- **`detectLegacyScreen` was restructured** (head/tail split) to keep SwiftLint's
  `cyclomatic_complexity` at or below 15 after the new `.trae` case; behavior is unchanged.

## Open questions

- The precise live working footer (interrupt-hint text and spinner glyph) once a
  standalone `traecli` TUI can be captured without the shared app-server.
- Whether the composer drops a paste-adjacent Enter the way Devin does; add
  `AgentComposerProfile` coverage only if `prowl send` acceptance shows dropped delivery.
